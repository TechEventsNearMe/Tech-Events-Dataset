  "description": "EdTech Summit Africa (ETSA) is an innovative professional development program that provides free hands-on technology training to educators and school leaders across Africa. Rather than a single annual event in Accra, ETSA operates through regional tours and collaborative workshops designed to empower teachers in underserved and under-resourced environments. The summit gathers local and global education experts to share 21st-century instructional strategies, focusing on digital literacy, education equity, and creative classroom technologies to improve student engagement and achievement."
